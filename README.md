### 1. Abstract

A fitness tracking dashboard displaying metrics from a large data set. Metrics include daily values of steps, minutes active, flights climbed, miles traversed, hours of sleep, quality of sleep, and hydration. The genesis of this project is multifactorial with intentions including practice writing ES6 classes that communicate, OOP design, writing modular, reusable code that follows the Single Responsibility Principle, and implementing a robust test suite using TDD.
