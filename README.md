## Introduction
Fitlit is a paired project for Module 2 at Turing School of Software & Design. For this project we worked with HTML, CSS, and various Javascript files. We explored the foundations of OOP by retrieving data from multiple class files. To test our functionality, we used the Mocha framework along with the Chai library. Our data folder contains all user data, our source folder contains our classes and our scripts.js handles our functinality. Our test folder maintains our testing suite.

## Learning Goals
* Implement ES6 classes that communicate to each other as needed
* Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP (Single Responsibility Principle)
* Implement a robust testing suite using TDD
* Use object and array prototype methods to perform data manipulation
* Display information on the page while maintaining ability to test class properties and methods
* Create a data dashboard that is easy to use and displays information in a clear way

## Overview
Fitlit is an activity tracker that tracks prepopulated data over the course of three months. The dashboard presents the user's hydration, sleep and activity information as well as weekly trends and comparisons to their peers.
