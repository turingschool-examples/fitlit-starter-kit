  ## Introduction
    The purpose of this project was to get practice with implementing infomation from an API onto our application. We used mocha and chai to test the functionality of our application as we created it. We did this by creating a fitness tracking app that contains several widgets that pull information from API's.

  ## Technologies
  - Javascript
  - HTML
  - CSS
  - Mocha/Chai
  - Webpack

  ## Features
  This application tracks a users sleep, hydration, and fitness goals and progress. It compares these statistics to their average and other users statistics.

  ## Page Demo

  ## Possible Future Extensions
  There will be a a second part to this application. Possible future extensions may include implementing Day.js or Chart.js to better display user statistics.

  ## Set Up
  1. Fork and clone this repo.
  2. Type `cd` to move into the root directory.
  3. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page (you should see some boilerplate HTML displayed on the page).  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.
