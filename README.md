# Fit-Lit 

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)
Here we built a fitness dashboard to display a random users info. This includes their hydration, sleep, and step activity along with their personal info.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)
1. Fork this repo - on the top right corner of this page, click the **Fork** button.
2. Clone down the _forked_ repo. Since you don't want to name your project "activity-tracker-starter", you can use an optional argument when you run git clone (you replace the [...] with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
3. Once you have cloned the repo, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
4. Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page.  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.  Closing the terminal without stopping the server first could allow the server to continue to run in the background and cause problems. This command is not specific to Webpack; make note of it for future use.   
5. Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.  This will update to the latest version of packages.  We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version. If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.  

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)
We were given approximately 11 days to work on this project.  We spent about 50 hours from start to finish.  We are on Week 3 of Mod 2.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)
- Gain an understanding of how to write clean HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand what it looks like to have a separate data model (using classes) and DOM display
- Incorporate & iterate over arrays in order to filter what is being displayed
- Craft code with clean style, using small functions that show trends toward DRYness and SRP
- Work with an API along with fetch calls and promises
- We worked with JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Git/GitHub workflow, API

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

#### Wins
- We got through all 4 iterations
- We had good communication and maintained a positive work environment
- We navigated working together and adapted to different team enironments (splitting off into pairs, working all together, etc...)

#### Challenges 
- We utilised our mentors/peers help when we were unable to come up with a solution
- We all have different schedules, and had to adjust to family/friends/health
