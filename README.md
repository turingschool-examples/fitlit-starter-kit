# FitLit: Get Down with the Fitness
## Group project

## OverView
Are you in need of some extra motivation?  Especially when it comes to working out?!  Look no further!  Use our app: Get Down with the Fitness to keep track of your daily/weekly steps goals, hydration stats, and sleep goals!  The best part is, you can compete and share with your friends!

# WE WILL ADD OUR GIF HERE!  

## Project Specs:
[Click to view rubric](http://frontend.turing.io/projects/fitlit.html).

## Local Setup instructions:

- Fork that repo! From the repo click the code button and copy the SSH link.
- All members of the group should clone down the _forked_ repo.
- Once cloned, change into the directory and install the project dependencies. Run `npm install` to install project dependencies.
- Run `npm start` in the terminal to see the HTML page.  `Control + C` is the command to stop running the local server.     
- Do not run `npm audit fix --force`.  This will update to the latest version of packages.  We need to be using `webpack-dev-server@3.11.2` which is not the latest version.  If you start to run into Webpack errors, first check that all group members are using the correct version.  

## Testing
There is no boilerplate for testing in this starter-kit repo. You will need to set this up yourself. However, if you ran `npm install`, then the tooling you need to start testing is already installed (`mocha` and `chai`).

## Technologies Used:
- ES6 Javascript
- CSS
- HTML
- Webpack
- Fetch API
- Mocha
- Chai

## Future Features & Goals:
- Add a user login page instead of generating a random user
- Add weekly charts/graphs for users to view their stats

## Project management:
- As a team, we first began working with logic in each class file.  Secondly, we used TDD to build our test suites for each class.  We then moved onto working with the DOM in Scripts.js
- We used a google sheet to manage our Excalidraws, ideas, and templates for the project:

- We used a [Github Project Board](https://github.com/Leoy23/down-with-the-fitness/projects) to stay on task and meet the deadline.
