# FitLit Week 8 Group Project: Part 1
A site for users to view their personal fitness journey and track fitness goals.

### Background 
This website was made with the goal of implementing the use of fetch API for the first time. This project had no comp so it was up to us to create  design and layout. We took inspiration from 80's fitness and 2000's graphics. Keeping the website simple in its functionality and robust in its colors. This website is not a 'functioning: website. All the data comes from a random data set made for this project. No users are real, and users cannot navigate to find specific information. Users are displayed in a random order.

### Installation
- Visit the [FitLit repository](https://github.com/AsherSpurr/fitlit)
- $ `git clone git@github.com:AsherSpurr/fitlit.git`
- $ `npm install`
- $ `npm start`
- Navigate to http://localhost:8080/ in your browser

### Next steps 
Additional enhancements could include:
- Incorporate user authorization for real people to use
- Adjust data placement and display to enhance readability
- Rethink selective color use to draw attention towards key information
- Provide a secure user portal that displays personal contact information
- Display friends list on a separate page with their current goals, allowing interaction between friends.
